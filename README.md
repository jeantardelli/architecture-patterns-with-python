# architecture-patterns-with-python

This repository contains code based on the lessons and teachings of the guide [Architecture Patterns with Python, Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven Microservices](https://github.com/cosmicpython/code/branches/all).

The aim of the book is to introduce several classic architectural patterns and show how they support TDD, DDD, and event-driven services. The book will serve as a reference for implementing them in a Pythonic way, and that people can use it as a first step toward further research in this field.
